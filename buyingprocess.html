						You can check out our <a href="/comingsoon.html">Coming Soon</a> page for when we expect
						upcoming litters. We will announce on our <a
							href="https://www.facebook.com/BluegrassDoodles/">Facebook Page</a>
						when we will start taking deposits on those litters. When litters are confirmed we ask for a non-refundable
						deposit via Stripe or Venmo.
						<br>
						<br>
						Pictures and videos will be posted often on social media and on our website. We also create your
						own page to display your puppy. We try to post every 2 weeks as they continue to grow.
						Your puppy will receive de-worming medicine at 3 weeks and 6 weeks.
						At 6 weeks they will also get their first full round of shots. It will be vet checked and
						cleared
						before going to it's forever home. Once the vet gives the puppy his final stamp of approval, the
						remaining balance
						will be due before or at the time the puppy is picked up. You'll receive all vet documents,
						health guarantee and goody bag at that time.
						<br>
            <p>
  To see which litters are planned next and when deposits will open, be sure to check our
