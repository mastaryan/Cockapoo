						<div class="bp-intro">
							<p>
								You can check out our <a href="/comingsoon.html">Coming Soon</a> page for when we expect
								upcoming litters. We will announce on our
								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BluegrassDoodles/">Facebook Page</a>
								when we will start taking deposits on those litters. When litters are confirmed, we ask
								for a <strong>non-refundable $50 deposit</strong> via Stripe or Venmo to reserve your
								spot in line.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our goal is to make the process simple and transparent from the very beginning. Below is
								an overview of what to expect from the time you reach out to us until your puppy goes
								home at around eight weeks of age.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="bp-timeline">

							<!-- Step 1 -->
							<div class="bp-step">
								<div class="bp-step-number">1</div>
								<h3>Connect & Reserve Your Spot</h3>
								<p>
									Start by contacting us about an upcoming or current litter. Once we’ve talked
									through timing and fit for your family, you can place your
									<strong>$50 non-refundable deposit</strong> via Stripe or Venmo to reserve a spot
									for that litter. If timing changes, your deposit can be moved to a future litter
									that works better for your schedule.
								</p>
								<p class="bp-meta">
									<strong>Communication:</strong> After your deposit is placed, we’ll confirm your
									spot, review expected timelines, and share how updates and selection will work for
									your specific litter.
								</p>
							</div>

							<!-- Step 2 -->
							<div class="bp-step">
								<div class="bp-step-number">2</div>
								<h3>Birth & Early Updates</h3>
								<p>
									Once puppies arrive, we share photos from birth and again once eyes open around
									2–3 weeks of age. Pictures and videos are posted on social media and on our website,
									and we can also send them directly to families on the reservation list.
								</p>
								<p class="bp-meta">
									We aim to update families several times as puppies grow so you can watch your future
									puppy develop from the very beginning.
								</p>
							</div>

							<!-- Step 3 -->
							<div class="bp-step">
								<div class="bp-step-number">3</div>
								<h3>Health Care & Growing Weeks</h3>
								<p>
									Puppies receive de-worming medicine at <strong>3 weeks</strong> and again at
									<strong>6 weeks</strong> of age. Around 5–6 weeks, we share another round of
									photos or videos so you can see coats and personalities starting to shine.
								</p>
								<p class="bp-meta">
									At <strong>6 weeks</strong> they will also get their first full round of shots.
									Each puppy is vet checked and cleared before going to its forever home, and you’ll
									receive a complete veterinary health record at pickup.
								</p>
							</div>

							<!-- Step 4 -->
							<div class="bp-step">
								<div class="bp-step-number">4</div>
								<h3>Puppy Selection</h3>
								<p>
									After the 6-week vet check, families can schedule an <strong>in-person
										selection</strong> visit. For those who live farther away or prefer not to
									travel, we can also assist with selection by <strong>FaceTime/video</strong> on
									request. We’ll talk through your preferences for gender, temperament, coat type,
									and markings to help match you with the right puppy.
								</p>
							</div>

							<!-- Step 5 -->
							<div class="bp-step">
								<div class="bp-step-number">5</div>
								<h3>Preparing for Go-Home Day</h3>
								<p>
									Puppies are typically ready to go home around <strong>8 weeks of age</strong>. Once
									the vet gives the puppy a final stamp of approval, the remaining balance will be due
									before or at the time the puppy is picked up.
								</p>
								<p class="bp-meta">
									We <strong>prefer cash at pickup</strong>, but we can also send a secure Stripe link
									ahead of time or accept Venmo at pickup (Friends &amp; Family only).
								</p>
							</div>

							<!-- Step 6 -->
							<div class="bp-step">
								<div class="bp-step-number">6</div>
								<h3>Go-Home Day & Health Guarantee</h3>
								<p>
									On pickup day you’ll receive all vet documents, our one-year genetic health
									guarantee, and a small goody bag to help your puppy settle into their new home.
								</p>
								<p class="bp-meta">
									Families are expected to keep up with their puppy’s vaccines and ongoing health
									care with their own veterinarian, which is required for the genetic health
									guarantee to remain in effect.
								</p>
							</div>
